Add stardates to your wordpress weblog

== Description ==

A powerful versitale stardate plugin with a wide array of functionalities for integrating stardates with your wordpress blog.

* URL `%stardate%` rewrite, like `/stardate-11504-20/title-goes-here` 
* filter various date functions, to have them display stardate instead, or filter nothing at all, and use the...
* `<?php the_stardate() ?>` function inside of your themes, to get post stardate.
* approximate stardate based on several different formulas and variants and sources (like trekguide and wikipedia), including XI (for modern movies) as well as Classic (from TNG, VOY ...)
* shortcodes, [stardate] will expand to the current timestamp in stardate fmt.
